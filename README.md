### This repository contains:
* A READme file detailing the assignment and the site
* Html.index file
* Assets folder that contains the following:
* Png file of the site
* Css folder containing css style sheet

This site was built from scratch. No code was provided to begin.

I started by using a wire frame to design the site followed by laying out the sections in HTML. I build this site from Desktop down which seemed fairly easy to operate with as there were not many elements to style.

Areas that I found particularly difficult were understanding how to create elements from the javascript to show the array of quesiotns and answers.

Below is a screenshot of what the site looks like now.
